# Node Word Guess

This is a simple word guess game that uses object oriented programming and recursion.

This is to be ran on a terminal that has node and npm.

The setup instructions are the following:
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/irvingrivas/constructor_word_guess"
cd constructor_word_guess
npm install
node index.js
```
* You play the game by guessing a letter of a random word.
* If you guess right, the letter is filled into the random word.
* Once you type in all the letters that comprise the word, you win!
